# Parallel Computing Snippets

This repository contains all experiments with different types of matrices(dense, sparse, bandes, etc.) and operations associated with it such as matrix-matrix multiplication, LU factorization and QR factorization.

- [1] Dense Matrix-Matrix Multiplication
- [2] Banded Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (with banded storage)
- [3] Sparse Matrix-Matrix multiplication [Coordinate Storage Format (COO)]
- [4] Sparse Matrix-Matrix multiplication [Compressed Storage Row (CSR)]
